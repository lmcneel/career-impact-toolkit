# 🧠 Career Log

Use this log to track the actual value of your day-to-day work. It’s designed for weekly or biweekly reflection and is most powerful when used consistently.

> Why keep a career log?  
> Because “what you did” is easy to forget. “What changed because of it” is what moves careers forward.
