# Metrics & Signals Cheat Sheet

> Not all impact is directly measurable. Signals reveal your value.

Use this cheat sheet to help you identify **evidence of impact** for your resume, career log, or project summaries.

## 💡 Common Metrics (When Available)

- Time saved (per user, per team, per deployment)
- Defect rate reduced
- Support tickets deflected
- Cycle time or lead time improved
- Uptime or availability increased
- Conversion rate or engagement lifted
- Bounce rate reduced
- Cost savings or revenue generated
- Pages per session or time-on-task improved
- Test coverage increased
- Team velocity or delivery confidence improved


## 🔍 Qualitative Signals of Impact

### 🧩 Product & User

- Stakeholders are asking fewer clarification questions
- Users are completing flows faster or more consistently
- Fewer “how do I…” questions in support channels
- Improved sentiment in interviews or surveys
- Features being adopted sooner or more widely


### 🛠️ Team & Engineering

- Code reviews get easier or faster
- Fewer rollbacks or hotfixes
- Onboarding becomes smoother with new docs or tools
- Other devs start copying your patterns or asking for advice
- Reduced decision fatigue or rework in your team


### 🧠 Process & Culture

- Your questions shift team strategy or surface unspoken assumptions
- Retrospectives note improved confidence, clarity, or speed
- Stakeholders start looping you in earlier
- You get asked to mentor, lead, or train others
- Feedback includes phrases like “that made my life easier” or “I didn’t realize how much I needed that”

## ✍️ How to Use This

- Add any applicable signals to your **Career Log**, **Project Tracker**, or **Feedback Tracker**
- Use them to rewrite task-based bullets into impact-driven statements
- Bring them to 1:1s or reviews as subtle proof of progress, even without hard metrics
